1.1.1 (December 17, 2013)
  - Cleaned up a few warnings

  - Examined reports of a segfault when reading text puzzles.  Fixed
    the segfault, but it appears this code has never worked correctly
    (in particular, clues are not assigned the right numbers).  It
    should not be used.

1.1.0 (July 16, 2010) adds several new features, including:

  - Support for rebus entries from the user.

  - Support for unlocking scrambled puzzle, given a code.

  - A brute force search to find the solution to any scrambled puzzle
    without the key.

  - Several bugs have been fixed and a number of internal functions
    have been cleaned up for better stability and memory handling.

1.0.0 (March 11, 2010) includes a variety of bug fixes and is thought
  to be relatively stable, based on use the application hcross.

0.0.2 adds support for various special features, like circles,
  rebuses, timers, etc.  Also various bug fixes.

0.0.1 is the initial release, so there's either not much NEWS, or
  everything is NEWS. =)

libpuz -- A PUZ crossword file library
Copyright (c) 2006 Josh Myer <josh@joshisanerd.com>

libpuz is a library which allows you to write software which can read
and write the binary PUZ file format, and can read the textual format.
It is intended for programmers to use, not for normal users.

This is the initial version of libpuz, warts and all.  For now, it has
a pretty complete (if rudimentary) implementation of the binary file
format.  All of the crucial checksum fields have been worked out, so
you can interoperate with commercial crossword software for basic
crosswords.  All advanced features are currently unimplemented (in
fact: they're mostly unknown).

The utils/ directory contains readpuz.c, a sample puzzle reader and
writer.  It can be used to read any PUZ file, and also to compile the
text format down to binary form.  It uses almost the entire read API;
I don't have a good PUZ writing example at the moment.

I welcome patches, constructive criticism, or general feedback.

* Installation should be straightforward.  For a default install, simply run

  > cabal install 
  
  or
  
  > sudo cabal install
  
  From this directory.


* If you don't want to install the package system wide, run:

  > cabal install --prefix=DIR



A couple other things to note:

* We require fairly recent versions of several libraries, so you should:

  > cabal update
  
  to make sure you have the latest package data.  Also, because cabal
  can't currently track dependencies on executables, it might fail with
  an unhelpful error message.  Try:

  > cabal install alex
  > cabal install happy
  > cabal install c2hs

  These dependencies are the most likely culprits.


* A bunch of warnings are generated by the c2hs code.  In particular,
  ignore two "definition but no type signature" warnings and a bunch
  of "Defined but not used: `res'" warnings.  These aren't concerning.

* Installation should be straightforward.  For a default install, simply run

  > cabal install 
  
  or
  
  > sudo cabal install
  
  From this directory.


* If you don't want to install the package system wide, run:

  > cabal install --prefix=DIR



A couple other things to note:

* Cabal should automatically get the haskell prerequisites from
  hackage.  Sometimes it seems to get confused about the order to try
  installing them in though.  If it complains about a missing package,
  first run: 

  > cabal update
  
  to make sure you have the latest package data.  Then try 
  
  > cabal list <packagename> 
  
  to see if it is in hackage, and finally 
  
  > cabal install <packagename>
  
  to install it.


* A bunch of warnings are generated by the c2hs code.  In particular,
  ignore two "definition but no type signature" warnings and a bunch
  of "Defined but not used: `res'" warnings.  These aren't concerning.

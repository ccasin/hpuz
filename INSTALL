Installation should be mostly straightforward if libpuz is installed
and in an "obvious" place.  Simply run

> cabal install 

From the root project directory.  If you don't want to install the
package system wide, run:

> cabal install --user --prefix=DIR



A couple of things to note:

- You must have libpuz installed.  You can get it here:
  http://freshmeat.net/projects/libpuz/


- If you install libpuz in a nonstandard location, you'll need to help
  cabal out.  If it can't find puz.h, try:

> cabal install --extra-include-dir=/path/to/puz.h

  If it can't find


- a bunch of warnings are generated by the c2hs code.  In particular,
  ignore two "definition but no type signature" warnings and a bunch
  of "Defined but not used: `res'" warnings.
